Problem to Solve
You are a mail clerk for the city of Boston and, as such, you oversee the delivery of mail across the city. For the most part, all packages sent are eventually delivered. Except, every once in while, a mystery falls into your lap: a missing package! For each customer that comes to you with a report of a missing package, your job is to determine:

The current address (or location!) of their missing package
The type of address or location (e.g. residential, business, etc.)
The contents of the package
All you know is what the customers themselves will tell you. To solve each mystery, you’ll need to use the mail delivery service’s database, packages.db, which contains data on the transit of packages around the city. Using just the information in the database, your task is to help each customer find their missing package.
